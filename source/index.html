        <h1>CV of Interactive &amp; User Experience Designer, Troy Ginbey</h1>
        <blockquote>I’ve been a professional designer &amp; creative in the digital &amp; media sectors since 2001.</blockquote>

        <section>
            <p>I’m thankful to have worked in a variety of landscapes in Perth and interstate, most recently co-founding a successful digital agency in Perth, <strong>Tune In Digital</strong>, leading as Creative Director, working in and alongside Ad Agencies, and a 6 year stint at <strong>Nova Radio</strong> (National Multimedia Developer).</p>

            <p>I’ve built my career on designing, developing and implementing creative communications strategies through design and leadership roles. I have worked with both large and small, commercial and not-for-profit brands including <strong>Nova Radio</strong>, <strong>Lions Eye Institute</strong>, <strong>Perth Advertising and Design Club</strong> (PADC), <strong>WAAMH</strong> (Western Australian Association for Mental Health), <strong>WANADA</strong> (Western Australian  and many more.</p>

            <p>I am seeking a permanent part time position, to compliment a new work / life balance I have constructed for myself. My ideal role would see me working 20-25 hours per week. I know that I can provide significant value to any business with my experience and time, whether it is working within or leading a design team.</p>

            <p>I am looking for my next unique challenge, and I look forward to bringing refreshing ideas to assist in your projects.</p>

            <p>Best regards,</p>

            <p>Troy Ginbey</p>

            <h2>Interesting (yet non-essential) reading.</h2>
            <p>I began with Nova Radio back in 2002, before the station launched. It was a 100% new brand to Australia, and had paid an obscene amount of money to purchase the first new licence to broadcast in Australia. DMG Australia was a joint venture between Australian media executives and DMG (Daily Mail, London). It was a big deal here and pretty surreal - we had a multi-million dollar radio station literally being built around us. The Red Hot Chili Peppers flew over to launch (Flea was responsible for the stations first language policy breach) I was lucky enough to be handy with a Nikon camera, and therefore met a lot of interesting people &amp; musicians as their defacto in-house photographer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I study art and have always loved to draw.</li>
                <li>I love to write. I publish articles on world class blogging channel, Medium.com.</li>
                <li>I have played the classical guitar from age 7.</li>
                <li>I'm a music junkie. I love everything from The Avalanches to Frank Zappa.</li>
                <li>I practice yoga most days</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case Study: Lions Laser vision</h2>
            <p>In my last role (Creative Director) at Digital agency "Tune In Digital", I worked with the Lions Eye Institute (LEI) to develop marketing &amp; communications strategies, both online and offline.</p>
            <p>As well as planning and advisory support, I led the design team in the creation and implementation of our products, working alongside LEI's Marketing Advisor. The outcome was a well rounded campaign designed to appeal directly to their market, utilising radio advertising on the Austereo network as well as Nova, driving traffic to a website specifically tailored to their audience. It involved pitching the campaign to LEI, working directly with LEI and Radio stations and consultation with their creative teams. The ‘See the world through your own eyes’ campaign continues to flourish today, generating outstanding results for LEI, converting leads from 29% of all unique visitors to the website.
